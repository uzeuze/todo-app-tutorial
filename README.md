# Building a To Do List App with React

This is a step-by-step tutorial that teaches you how to build to-do list app with React. After completing this tutorial you will get basic understanding of:

* How to bootstrap a React project with `create-react-app` command-line utility,  
* React-Bootstrap which seems the most popular UI framework.

## Create a new App

Install Create React App globally.

`npm install -g create-react-app`

Use Node >= 6 and npm >= 3 for faster installation speed and better disk usage. This tool doesnâ€™t assume a Node backend. The Node installation is only required for the build tools that rely on it locally, such as Webpack and Babel.

To create a new app, run:

```
create-react-app todo_app
cd todo_app
```

Run the app in development mode with 'npm start' command. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Change title tag to 'To-Do App' in public/index.html.
